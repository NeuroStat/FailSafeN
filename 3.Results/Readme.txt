In “scen1” the results for the scenario with 1 peak per study can be found, in “scen2” the results for 8 peaks per study and in “scen3” the results for a random number of peaks per study.
The text-files are divided in three columns. The first column is the seed used for simulations, the second column lists the FSN and the third column is the percentage of real studies in the total number of studies.
In the filename the thresholding method, statistical threshold, average sample size and scenario is printed.
